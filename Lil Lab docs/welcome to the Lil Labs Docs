The Lil Lab app isn't entirely hard to use, however it could be confusing where to start as it is (if not a regular modder) a quite a foreign type of app,
make sure to infer to the scripting section to learn how to use our visual language "Lab Visi"

if you go through ever folder + subfolder in order, you will be able to fluently use our app with occasional look backs to check issues
