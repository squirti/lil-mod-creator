# lil-mod-creator
An app that allows editing the lil guy's game by Radnyx easier in every way, this app, however, is very beta and needs some major updates coming in the main release, so expect missing features and some bugs. Thank you for using the app, however (if you do decide to)

if you haven't joined the lil guys discord please do, you'll find modding help there in their official channel (please understand this is **not** our discord server but the official games server

I'll be adding tutorials and sharing mod files a thing in the future, and there will be a lot of ui updates, as well as the ability to create new stuff (when the modding support appears)

For any GitHub contributors who would wish to help with the progress of the app, feel free to create pull requests. You can edit the project by importing the project folder to Godot and saving it as a new version:
